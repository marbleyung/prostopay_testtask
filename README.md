"task 2:
Write small service class with methods
get(user_id) â†’ UserDTO
add(user: UserDTO)

signatures can be changed if you think it's needed for better implementation

UserDTO - pydantic model
users are stored in db.
assume you have method get_async_session, which returns AsyncSession sqlalchemy object to interact with db

write tests for that class.

add notes with argumentation for choosen implementation."
